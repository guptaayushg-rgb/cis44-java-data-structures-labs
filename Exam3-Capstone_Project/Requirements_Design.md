Design Document Explanation:

I choose to do my project involving a decision tree because I like how the decisions that the decision tree makes affects people's lives in the real world with things such as loans. People get loans from banks and are often questioned about the intent of the use of the money they receive from the loans, and factors are considered such as a person’s credit score and income. There are many rules that a person must adhere to before receiving a rule, and these rules are properly organized into a set of hierarchical questions by the decision tree easing the loaning process. There are nodes and leafs to the decision tree; the nodes are analogous to a decision; the leaves are similar to if a loan is Approved or Rejected.




Big-O Justification Paragraph

The Decision tree allows for the program to run on maximum efficiency. To see a loan and an input from a user is time saving and you would only need to go down one path to give a value for the elements, from the root of the tree to the leaf. Every time a decision is made all the elements are cut into half, they are divided, and this is repeated until O(log n ) is fulfilled. If the tree becomes very similar to a linked list it is a linked list, or becomes very similar to a linked list and the time it will take for the program to run will be O(n) and each of the O(n) will have a node that is being contained. Decision Trees are very important as they speed up Lookup searched a lot.
